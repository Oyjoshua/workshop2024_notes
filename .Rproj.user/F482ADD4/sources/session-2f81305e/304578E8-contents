###1. The dataset cars included with R provides data on speed 
### (variable = speed, in mph) versus stopping distance 
### (variable = dist, in feet) in cars. Use these data to develop an R script:

# Loading the dataset
data(cars)

##1a.  compute the sample mean, median, mode, sample variance, standard 
## deviation, and CV for speed and distance

x <- c(cars$speed)   # Loading "speed" data from 'cars' dataset

# ?mean              # Using Help function to find the right code for mean 
xm <- mean(x)        # Computing sample mean for speed
xmd <- median(x)     # Computing sample median for speed

#Computing sample mode for speed
xmo <- as.numeric(names(sort(table(x), decreasing=TRUE)[1]))

x_var <- var(x)      # Computing sample variance for speed
x_sd <- sd(x)        # Computing standard deviation for speed

y <- c(cars$dist)    # Loading "distance" data from 'cars' dataset
ym <- mean(y)        # Computing mean for distance
ymd <- median(y)     # Computing median for distance

ymo <- as.numeric(names(sort(table(y), decreasing=TRUE)[1])) #Computing sample mode for distance

y_var <- var(y)     # Computing variance for distance
y_sd <- sd(y)      # Computing standard deviation for distance
xy_cv <- cov(x,y)  # Computing covariance for speed and distance

##1b.  create a histogram of speed and one of dist
hist(x, main="Histogram of Speed", xlab="Speed (mph)")
hist(y, main="Histogram of Distance", xlab="Distance (ft)")

##1c. Create a scatterplot of speed (x) versus dist (y)
plot(x, y, main="Scatterplot of Speed vs Distance", xlab="Speed (mph)", ylab="Distance (ft)")

##1d. Create a new object with the natural log of dist and create a histogram
log_y <- log(y)
hist(log_y, main="Histogram of Log(Distance)", xlab="Log(Distance)")

##1e. Create a scatterplot of speed versus log(dist)
plot(log_y, x, main="Scatterplot of Speed vs Log(Distance)", xlab="Log(Distance)", ylab="Speed (mph)")


###2. Assemble a data frame named 'df' that has 500 rows and contains four variables:
set.seed(123) #for reproducibility

##creating the 4 variables
plot_ID = 1:500
x1 = rnorm(500, mean=50, sd=5)
x2 = rpois(500, lambda=2.5)
log_x2 <- log(x2)

##Creating the dataframe df
df <- data.frame(plot_ID, x1, x2, log_x2)

##2a. Create boxplots for x2 and log_x2
boxplot(df$x2, main="Boxplot of x2", ylab="x2")
boxplot(df$log_x2, main="Boxplot of Log(x2)", ylab="Log(x2)")
